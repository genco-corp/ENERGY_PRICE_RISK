# Technical Documentation for Electricity Price Forecasting Application

Before diving into the details, this application will leverage state-of-the-art machine learning and time series algorithms to predict electricity prices for a 30-day horizon with high accuracy. The implemented system uses a hybrid approach combining decomposition techniques, feature engineering, and ensemble learning to capture both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends in electricity markets.

## System Architecture and Overview

The electricity price forecasting application will be built as a web-based platform with a modular architecture consisting of four primary components:

1. **Data Ingestion Module**: Responsible for collecting, validating, and preprocessing input data
2. **Feature Engineering Module**: Transforms raw data into relevant features for the prediction models
3. **Prediction Engine**: Implements the ensemble of forecasting algorithms
4. **Visualization Interface**: Presents forecasts and uncertainty metrics through an interactive dashboard

### Technological Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js with Recharts for interactive visualizations
- **Backend**: Python (Flask/FastAPI) for API endpoints and model serving
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
- **Machine Learning**: PyTorch, XGBoost, Prophet, statsmodels
- **Database**: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production
- **Deployment**: Docker containerization within Replit environment

## Data Requirements and Sources

### Essential Input Data

1. **Historical Price Data**
   - Minimum 1 year of hourly electricity prices for the target market
   - Format: CSV or JSON with timestamp and price columns
   - Sources: Market operator APIs, energy data repositories, or user uploads[3][18]

2. **Weather Data**
   - Temperature, wind speed, solar irradiance, and precipitation forecasts
   - Granularity: Hourly for the prediction period
   - Sources: Open-Meteo API or Solcast for solar forecasting[4]

3. **Market-Specific Factors**
   - Generation capacity by source type (thermal, hydro, wind, solar)
   - Planned outages or maintenance schedules
   - Interconnection capacity with neighboring markets[3][6]

4. **Calendar Features**
   - Holidays, special events
   - Day of week, hour of day[19]

5. **Optional Enrichment Data**
   - Fuel prices (natural gas, coal)
   - CO2 emission prices
   - System load forecasts[6]

## Algorithm Selection and Methodology

Based on analysis of recent research, a multi-layered hybrid approach is optimal for 30-day electricity price forecasting[1][11][19]. The system will implement:

### 1. Data Preprocessing and Decomposition

```python
# Pseudocode for data preprocessing pipeline
def preprocess_data(price_data, weather_data, market_data):
    # Time alignment and resampling
    aligned_data = align_timestamps(price_data, weather_data, market_data)
    
    # Missing value handling
    clean_data = handle_missing_values(aligned_data)
    
    # Decomposition using CEEMDAN to separate components
    decomposed_series = ceemdan_decomposition(clean_data['price'])
    
    # Feature engineering for each component
    engineered_features = []
    for component in decomposed_series:
        features = extract_features(component, clean_data)
        engineered_features.append(features)
    
    return clean_data, decomposed_series, engineered_features
```

The Complementary Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) will be employed to decompose the electricity price series into multiple intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), separating the signal into trend, seasonal, and residual components[1][19].

### 2. Feature Selection and Engineering

For each decomposed component and prediction horizon, the system will:

1. Calculate temporal features (hour of day, day of week, month)
2. Create lagged features of prices at various intervals (t-24, t-48, t-168)
3. Generate rolling statistics (mean, std, min, max) at multiple windows
4. Incorporate weather forecasts and their derivatives
5. Apply Spearman correlation and XGBoost feature importance to select optimal feature sets[1][19]

### 3. Multi-Model Ensemble Architecture

The core prediction engine will implement a three-tier forecasting approach:

**Tier 1: Base Models for Each Decomposed Component**
- LSTM/BiLSTM networks for capturing temporal dependencies
- XGBoost for handling non-linear relationships
- Prophet for detecting seasonality and holiday effects[1][11][14][19]

**Tier 2: Specialized Models for Different Time Horizons**
- Short-term (1-3 days): Higher weight on recent data and hourly patterns
- Medium-term (4-14 days): Balanced approach with weekly patterns
- Long-term (15-30 days): Greater emphasis on fundamental factors and seasonal trends[3]

**Tier 3: Meta-Ensemble Model**
- A meta-learner (gradient boosting) will combine predictions from all base models
- Optimized using Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA) for hyperparameter tuning[1][19]

```python
# Pseudocode for model ensemble
def build_ensemble():
    models = []
    
    # BiLSTM model
    bilstm = BiLSTM(
        input_dim=feature_count,
        hidden_dim=128,
        num_layers=2,
        dropout=0.2
    )
    
    # XGBoost model
    xgb = XGBRegressor(
        n_estimators=200,
        learning_rate=0.05,
        max_depth=6,
        subsample=0.8,
        colsample_bytree=0.8
    )
    
    # Prophet model
    prophet = Prophet(
        seasonality_mode='multiplicative',
        changepoint_prior_scale=0.1
    )
    
    # Meta-ensemble
    meta_model = LightGBM(
        num_leaves=31,
        learning_rate=0.05,
        n_estimators=100
    )
    
    return MultiModelEnsemble(
        base_models=[bilstm, xgb, prophet],
        meta_model=meta_model
    )
```

### 4. Hyperparameter Optimization

The application will implement two optimization algorithms:

1. **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** for tuning parameters of statistical models[9][17]
2. **Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA)** for neural network architecture optimization[1][19]

These optimization techniques have demonstrated superior performance in recent electricity price forecasting literature compared to standard grid or random search methods[17].

   - Evaluate against commercial forecasting services where available

## Conclusion and Deployment Notes

This electricity price forecasting application leverages cutting-edge machine learning techniques specifically optimized for energy markets. The hybrid approach combining time series decomposition, multiple specialized algorithms, and ensemble learning provides robust performance across different market conditions and time horizons.

For deployment, the application should be containerized using Docker to ensure reproducibility and scalability. Replit's environment supports this workflow and allows for straightforward hosting of the web interface with automated CI/CD capabilities.

## Required User Inputs Summary

To generate accurate forecasts, users must provide:
